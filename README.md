# 🌾 FasalMitra – Prototype

FasalMitra is a front-end prototype that demonstrates how warehouse-stored crops can be digitally recorded and used to simulate post-harvest loan approval.

This version is a proof-of-concept built to demonstrate system flow between:

- Warehouse / FPO
- Digital Crop Deposit Record
- Lender
- Loan Confirmation

---

## 📌 What This Prototype Shows

This project demonstrates:

- Crop entry by warehouse staff
- Generation of a digital deposit record
- Warehouse stock summary page
- Lender dashboard view
- Loan approval confirmation

The goal is to simulate how stored agricultural produce can be treated as a verified digital asset.
